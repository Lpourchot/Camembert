# Camembert
Camembert (Bert model for french) fine tuned for sentiment analysis
As I did not find relevant french dataset for sentiment analysis, I downloaded an english version for a translation to french.
The original Camenbert has been tuned with the translated dataset and has reached near 90% of accuracy on test dataset. Not too bad :-)
The Dataset has been limited with short sentences (2000 rows) to avoid a too long training (without GPU)
